## About

This is the port of ai-duet experiment by google: https://github.com/googlecreativelab/aiexperiments-ai-duet where, instead of using performanceRNN we are using ![Music Transformer](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/music-transformer)

> DISCLAIMER: This code is **super experimental**. please run it with a big grain of salt.

## CREDITS from original repo

The original ai-duet experiment was Built by [Yotam Mann](https://github.com/tambien) with friends on the Magenta and Creative Lab teams at Google. It uses [TensorFlow](https://tensorflow.org), [Tone.js](https://github.com/Tonejs/Tone.js) and open-source tools from the [Magenta](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/) project. Check out more at [A.I. Experiments](https://aiexperiments.withgoogle.com).


## INSTALLATION

* Clone this repo in your desired folder
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MrityunjayBhardwaj/aiDuet-with-Music-Transformer.git
```

* Create and activating a virtual environment ( or use the existing one if you are feeling adventurous :P )

    if you are using conda then you can simply run this command :-

    ```bash
    conda create --name myenv python=3.7.7
    ```

    this will create a new virtual environment called myenv with python=3.7.7 preinstalled

    after that, you can activate this virtual environment by simply running this command:

    ```bash
    conda activate myenv
    ```

* for installing the rest of the dependencies :- simply go to the sever folder and install all the dependencies from requirements.txt

```bash
 cd server
 pip install -r requirements.txt
```

* the checkpoints for music Transformer can be found here:-

    ```bash
    gsutil -q -m cp -r gs://magentadata/models/music_transformer/primers/* ./assets/checkpoints
    ```

    also, soundFont can be fetched using "gsutil" as well:

    ```bash
    gsutil -q -m cp gs://magentadata/soundfonts/Yamaha-C5-Salamander-JNv5.1.sf2 ./assets/soundFonts
    ```


* Then, to build and install the front-end Javascript code, first make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 6 installed. And then install of the dependencies of the project and build the code by typing the following in the terminal: 


```bash
cd static
npm install
npm run build
```

Finally, to run this webapp simply type ( and hope for the best):

```bash
python server.py
```

You can then play with A.I. Duet at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).


## MIDI SUPPORT

The A.I. Duet supports MIDI keyboard input using [Web Midi API](https://webaudio.github.io/web-midi-api/) and the [WebMIDI](https://github.com/cotejp/webmidi) library. 

## PIANO KEYBOARD

The piano can also be controlled from your computer keyboard thanks to [Audiokeys](https://github.com/kylestetz/AudioKeys). The center row of the keyboard is the white keys.
